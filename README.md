# FoodBank
Ruby based project implementing a Diet Manager. The project was able to maintain a database of foods - both basic foods and recipes composed of other foods (both recipes and basic). In addition, it is able to maintain a log of foods that the user consumes each day. Commands gives the user the opportunity to add and delete foods, to log and unlog foods for a given date, to save the log and food database, and to print a variety of reports.
